                <p>This project was created as the final project for the 2023-2024 CAS Computer Science class at
                    Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences in Santa Monica, California. The dataset was taken from a
                    dataset titled "California House Price" by Shibu Mohapatra in Kaggle. The project used a Python
                    notebook to load the data set, explore and preprocess the data, and perform both a linear regression
                    and a random forest model. These tasks were critical to analyze the big data and create accurate
                    models that used the data to predict house prices. Using HTML, CSS, and Python, an effective website
                    was created, allowing the user to estimate a the price of a specific property.

                <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
                <p>I would like to firstly thank Paul Way, the professor of the CAS Computer Science class and the
                    Upper School Technology Coordinator. Thanks to him, this project was assigned. Without his
                    constant support and encouragement throughout the way, I would not be able to get this project
                    done. Thank you. Linked below are also the links to websites, databases, and videos that I used
                    as aid and inspiration for this project. Finally, I would like to thank my family. From my
                    mother and father to my aunts and uncles, each member of my family has played a significant,
                    crucial role in my life. They raised me properly and taught me how to always persevere, a
                    critical trait for this computer science project.
                </p>
